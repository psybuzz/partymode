The Modal Collective
=========

<<<<<<< HEAD
PartyMode: Make any website full of funk.  Just add music.
*It works well on picture-heavy sites. ;)

VeryGlassy: See the web with a different pair of eyes.  Experience what 285 million others already do.
*It works well on shorter sites.

The Modal Collective is a set of bookmarklets that challenge the way people perceive websites.

Simply visit: http://partymode.herokuapp.com to get the bookmarklets, or assemble it from the JS source in partymode.js.
